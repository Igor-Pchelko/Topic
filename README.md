Topic - fake job project on which i spent about 3 work days.
=====

I've applied on oDesk to https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Senior-iOS-Developer-Objective-WebServices-API_%7E017c10b03fef92a094

Then contacted via Will Patros from ZEP who asked mine Skype ID to call me.

Then "Hanry Falccoi" introduced as PM from Carl Zeiss. He sent me this project, and asked to make some changes as first test. I did it then he asked me to do other changes and so on. Then he said he went to conference, and other person will contact me.

So 2 other persons are "John Morris" aka TM and "Josyko" aka CTO. All of them have fake User IDs from inet images.

I think they/he could change nicks and pictures on skype. But I hope it will be tricky to change all sources. This is why I publish then on GitHub.

Hope I'll help someone to prevent do something for that cheater.
